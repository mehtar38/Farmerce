# Farmerce
A project in C focusing on direct selling from farmers to customers. Functionalities include login and sign up options, checking for the availability of fruits and vegetables, adding to cart, removing from cart and payment on user end and updating stock, restocking and payment for restocking on farmerâ€™s end.

# Personal Notes
This is a project built in 2021, the first time I ever leanrt to write code. It took almost 40 days of genuine effort. 
The code has 3340 lines of manually written code in C with an immense scope of improvement. 
There are a lot of lines of code trying to manually achieve the printing of the list of vegetables and fruits available, checking cart availability. and a jarring amount of goto statements. 
While the code works just fine, it can be written much more efficiently. 
The only reason I put it up is so I can work on it again someday, this time in Java and release it!

Also attaching the final presentation we gave for the project with screenshots of the working.
